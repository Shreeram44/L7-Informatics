# Choco House Application

## Problem Statement
Create a Simple Python Application for a fictional chocolate house that uses SQLite to manage,
Seasonal flavor offerings 
Ingredient inventory
Customer flavor suggestions and allergy concerns

## Overview
This is a Django-based web application for a fictional chocolate house. It allows management of:
- **Seasonal flavor offerings**: Displays current flavors available for a season.
- **Ingredient inventory**: Tracks the stock of ingredients used for flavors.
- **Customer flavor suggestions and allergy concerns**: Customers can suggest flavors and report allergy concerns.

This application uses **SQLite** as the database and includes **Docker** for easy setup.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:
- Python 3.9+
- Docker and Docker Compose

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone the project to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shreeram44/L7-Informatics.git
cd choco-house
```

### Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment
It’s a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects:
```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies
Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Set up the database
Run the following commands to apply the migrations and set up the SQLite database:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 5: Create a superuser (optional)
If you want to access the admin interface:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### Step 6: Run the development server
Start the Django development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The app will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Using Docker

### Step 1: Build and run the Docker container
Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system. Then, build and start the container using `docker-compose`:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will run the app inside a Docker container, exposing it at `http://localhost:8000/`.

### Step 2: Stopping the containers
To stop the running Docker containers:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Application Features

### 1. Seasonal Flavors
The application displays the current seasonal flavors that are available. Navigate to:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/flavors/
```

### 2. Customer Flavor Suggestions
Customers can submit flavor suggestions and report allergy concerns at:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/suggestions/
```

### 3. Admin Interface
If you created a superuser, you can log in to the Django admin interface to manage seasonal flavors, ingredients, and customer suggestions:
```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

## Running Tests
To validate the application functionality, use the following command to run the test cases:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

The tests include:
- Checking if the seasonal flavors are displayed correctly.
- Validating customer suggestions form.

## Edge Case Handling
Here are some edge cases considered in the project:
1. **No Seasonal Flavors Available**: If no seasonal flavors are available, a message is shown to the user.
2. **Empty Customer Suggestions**: When a user submits the form without filling in required fields, appropriate validation messages are shown.
3. **Allergy Concern Field**: If a customer doesn’t have any allergy concerns, the field can be left blank.

## SQL Queries and ORM Abstraction
The application primarily uses Django's ORM to interact with the SQLite database. For example:
```python
# Get all seasonal flavors that are still available
flavors = SeasonalFlavor.objects.filter(available_until__gte=datetime.date.today())
```

No direct SQL queries were used, adhering to Django's ORM abstraction.

## Docker Build and Run Commands
1. **Build Docker Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. **Run the Application**:
   The app will run at `http://localhost:8000/`.

3. **Stop Docker Containers**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

## Additional Notes
- Ensure Docker is running if you choose the containerized version.
- Handle form validations on the front-end and back-end for user inputs.
